Elm is a programming language designed to make writing frontend web apps
pleasant, predictable, and easy to maintain.

It is purely functional and much easier to learn from scratch and use than,
say, Haskell or TypeScript.

It's probably one of the best languages yet for learning to program for the
first time. It's been growing in popularity and has inspired lots of other
libraries and languages.

Elm goes to great lengths to provide the developer with a consistent
experience, and has a great compiler that helps catch mistakes and makes
refactoring easier.
