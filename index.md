# Frictionless

Hi there! 👋

Helder here. (You might know me as [@agentofuser](https://agentofuser.com).)

I'm just starting to take my first steps into both [[Elm]] and [[Fission]], and
I'm very excited about writing apps using them together.

Of course, being a n00b is the best time to put yourself into a beginner's
shoes, and a beginner's instructions are often more helpful to another beginner
than an expert's.

So hopefully I'll manage to report my mishaps and successes in this journey
with a small enough latency for you to get the most out of them on your own
path to building **frictionless fission apps** with Elm 🌳 ;)

Glide on ⛸⛸❄️
