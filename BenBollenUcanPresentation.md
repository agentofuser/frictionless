# UCAN (do) secure key management in the browser, with Ben Bollen

Video:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQgecoUvmjU

## Notes

- High-level idea I got (?) is that UCANs help bridge [[OCAP]] world from
  browsers (bearer tokens) to [[ACL]] world of blockchains (keypairs)
- 2-of-2 BLS public key and signature combination magic stuff seems really cool
  - from what I understand this means you can have something that behaves like
    a single keypair without there being a private key that can be stolen
- Slides mention 2FA not really being an option somehow, but there has to be a
  "cosigner", so not sure who the second entity in the "2-of-2" thing is
- Very condensed stuff, will have to look more careful into whitepaper and
  specs
