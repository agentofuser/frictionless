Fission is batteries-included gone mad.

It's everything I've always dreamed I had so I could work on making great apps,
get paid, and feel like I'm not throwing the user under the bus.

Things that I like about it:

- **User-owned data**: you know how some native apps let you choose a folder in
  your Dropbox, iCloud, or Google Drive so they store your data there, then you
  can use it with other apps, look into it, and the app maker can't see your
  stuff and doesn't need to run servers? It's like that, except that it's an
  open source, end-to-end encrypted kind of Dropbox, so _nobody_ can see your
  stuff, not the app maker _nor_ Fission, only your own devices. No lock-in,
  yes privacy. On the web!
- Lots more TBD

## Deep Dive

To get a better idea about how Fission pulls off all this cool stuff and what
other things are made possible by it, one of the best places to start is this
presentation by co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka:

This presentation is when I first understood what Fission was all about and got
[very excited](https://twitter.com/agentofuser/status/1194696675727749121)
about it.
